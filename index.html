      <p class="lead">When it comes to beauty, men and women have different definitions of it. For women beauty is an attractive figure and lush complexion. For men, it is an ideal body (good height, well build up body, dark complexion and so forth), which Gynecomastia can really distort. <span class="fgr">This condition can lead to extreme stress and embarrassment for men</span>.</p>

<h2>What is Gynecomastia?</h2>
<img src="images/gyno-man-boobs.jpg" alt="gynecomastia" class="rounded float-right gbr"><p>Gynecomastia is basically a condition in which men grow large breasts, also known as man boobs. This is a common disorder that men suffer from and is a great confidence killer for them. In this condition, men start to develop big breasts similar to females due to excessive estrogen in their body.</p>

<p>Most baby boys suffer from it, as estrogen levels are greater in them and is transferred from their mothers. As males age, this problem seems to settle as estrogen level lowers, but not all men are as lucky. Some men do not get better as they age and no matter how slim and trim they are, their breasts are larger than normal, which damages their personality a lot.</p>

<h3 id="Diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Your physician asks you questions regarding your medical and drug background and what health issues run as part of your family. The physician may also start a bodily check-up that might contain a careful look at your breast tissue, abdomen, and genitals.</p>

<p>Initial tests to look for the trigger of the gynecomastia could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloodstream tests</li>
<li>Mammograms</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll need more testing based on your original test results, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computerized tomography or most known as CT scans</li>
<li>MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) scans</li>
<li>Testicular ultrasounds</li>
<li>Tissue biopsies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Symptoms">Problems that trigger related symptoms</h3>
<p>Your physician will need to make sure the breast swelling is true gynecomastia instead of a different issue. Other concerns that produce identical symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fatty breast tissue</b>. Many males and youngsters have extra chest fat that looks like gynecomastia. This is known as false gynecomastia (pseudogynecomastia), and this is not identical to gynecomastia.</li>
<li><b>Breast cancer</b>. It's unusual in males, but they can happen. Enlargement of a single breast or even the existence of a firm nodule adds to the problem for male breast cancer.</li>
<li><b>A breast abscess (mastitis)</b>. It is really a disease of the breast tissue.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Treatments">Gynecomastia treatment options</h3>

<p>There are many treatment options available for Gynecomastia, but 3 most common treatment options are:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Taking compression vests</b>: These are tight shirts than you can wear in order to hide Gynecomastia temporarily. Please note that this shirt may not be everyone’s piece of cake as it may be uncomfortableto wear. Broadly speaking, it’s like a bra that you can use to hide your boobs beneath, but not any solution to this problem. Also, you may feel pain in chest after using it for so long (due to severe compression).</li>
